# Intro
* Bot insight -> analytics platform
* Rpa platform -> task and meta bot, meta bot is the advanced version of the task bot
* Cognitive platform-> IQ bot 

# RPA platform
* Rule based
* front end automation
* Multi system integration
* Structured Data

# Cognitive platform
* Algorith based decision
* self learning activity
* Vision,NLP
* Semi structured data
* Dark data ->semi structured(pdf,images) or unstructured , 80 % data is in this form
* IQ bots helps to work on semi structured or unstructred data
* ML and AI abilities are supported with IQ bots

# Analytics Platform
* Provides business insights
* measures effectiveness
* make scaling decisions
* how much should be invest to make sure revnue is being generated

# Able to automate
* reading data from certain platform and writing to another
* works both for web bases and desktop based
* works awesome with Structured Data and good with semi-structured
* rule based decisions

# lacks
* Not able to work with handwritten data
* non rule based general calls

# Notes
* Once bot is set up on control room then it can be used to all other machines connected with same control room
* There are 2 types of clint: 
  1. Development Client -> bot creators
  2. Runtime Client -> bot execution, required once the bot is deployed to control room
* v-10.5, 8GB of RAM is required, CLient only would require 4gb RAM
* current version-: 11.3.3
* Latest Version of AAE Client requires around 16GB RAM
* Control room is equipped with lots of tools and activities, its different in version 11 then 10
* AA community is applicable only for 1 month
* License in AA are customized thus can be developed based on requirements and charges will be applicable as per the needs
* To execute or use the Control Room , we require License to be uploaded on server through the control room application only
* Bots can be scheduled to be execute at certain time only
* autologin feature -> it allows the machine to unlock the software, login the client and do the automated tasks

# Runtime Client
* It is classified into 2 catgories:
  1. Attended -> Requires human interaction
  2. Unattended -> no human interaction required
  
# Time to Create
* KeyStrokes -> insert data in some other application
* Select Window shows the list of all applications opened on your system
* to perform certain hotkey actions just choose options from given list
e.g [ENTER]
* the commands can be reordered by move up or move down option
* Open Program/Files -> to open application,just type its name
* To upload your bot to main control room , just right click on bot file and click upload
* Community edition software does not have access to control room(users can not be created, licenss can not be managed)
* ```atmx``` standard bot file extension
* Repository Manager -> it allows the control room admin to run or schedule the uploaded bots
* To create a user:
  1. Actions Tab
  2. Create User Tab
  3. Set the details and all details are editable
* Various Roles available
  1. Admin -> can never login to the client and make bot, License Allocation:None
  2. AnalyticsConsumer -> work on BotInsight platform, utilize the reports
  3. AnalyticsExpert -> work on BotInsight platform, process the reports
  4. Basic -> mandatory, as it allows to login , for both runner and developer client
  5. IQBotServices  -> Cognitive platform
  6. IQBotValidator -> Cognitive platform
* Automation Anywhere works on R back policy, custom bots can be created to restrict or determine the permissions allowed for a user
* Control Room Recognizes the ```BOTS``` based on their machine id
* Operation Room -> Shows the task that are currently in progress
* Audit Trail -> Its the log file which stores the data regarding each and every activity, success / failures , reasons etc.
* Roles and Permission -> These can be set in control room and custom roles can be created as well
* App Management -> To integrate the system with other applications
* Outgoing Mail Server Application -> to send mails with reference to working or progress of any bots can be set
* On Installation of Control Room , two categories or options are available:
  1. Express Mode -> the master key gets set with machine
  2. Manual Mode -> master key is need to be given at every login instance
* Secure Recording -> It is required to be ```enabled``` so that the recorder would not record snapshots and take only Abstract information
* Help / Support -> it can be customized as per the need

## To Set Auto Login
* Click on Tools
* Click Options
* In Login Settings
  * Set Username and Password
  * Check auto login and scheduler task
  * Finally Apply
 
## Workflow Designer
* Helps to maintain the libraries of the bots
* every workflow can have only single start button
* To Create a ```WorkFlow```
  1. Click on Workflow
  2. Click New Workflow
  3. Drag and Drop ```Start``` activity
  4. ```Run Task``` -> this activity selects the pre build bots or tasks
    * ```Repeat``` -> recursive action
    * ```speed``` -> the way to complete the task, in real time , at backend etc
    * ```Variable``` -> to set dynamic variables for our task such as login credentials
* Its a kind of UML Diagram which can be designed as well as executed at the same moment

## Properties
* ```View Logs``` -> this option is used to check the log file
* ```TimeOut``` -> any bot can be given a timeout after which even if the application wouldn't have completed execution, it will be terminated
* ```Notification``` -> once email settings are done, one can use it to send mails with email trigger
* ```HotKey``` -> shortcut can be set to run some bot

## SCHEDULE
* It can be used to schedule a particular bot and for it t, the machine password is mandatory to be specified

# Practical
# Recorders
* There are 3 types of Recorders:
  1. Smart Recorder
  2. Screen Recorder
  3. Web Recorder
  
## Smart Recorder
* It captures the coordinates
* It captures the image in background
* It captures the object

## Screen Recorder
* Captures mouse movements,clicks and keystrokes

## Web Recorder
* Based or made for internet related tasks, IE supportable 100% and only
* It provides encoding feature of different languages

# 3rd October
## DataBase
* Microsft Access -> Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider
* Connect -> this is command used to connect MS access with AA
* Prompt -> Used to prompt user to get an input for True/False or Yes/No which can be stored in a variable
* It has 4 types of commands:
  * Prompt for Value
  * Prompt for File
  * Promp for Folder
  * Prompt for Yes/No
* In prompt, there is option for ```Select Window``` in that use ```Don't write in Any Window``` to make sure what screen will be seen in background while prompt is there
* SQL Commands are not supposed to end with semi-column ```;```
* The input given by user is ```Generic``` by default

    


## Variable Manager
* Create custom variables
* Value Type -> start with 'v' letter for variable name
* Array Type -> start with 'arr' letter for array name
* List Type -> start with 'list' word for list name
* New variables can be created by just using the ```Add``` button

## Read From CSV/Text
* It is an activity which can be used to read data from CSV or Text File
* ```Delimeter``` -> used to differentiate data
* By default Read CSV file activity iterates over line by line
* ```$Counter$``` is an inbuilt function which can be used to iterate and show no of iterations done

## Error Handling
* Isolates errors that occur when running tasks
* To Continue the task even if some error occurs , it is used
* Various Error Handling Options are:
  1. Take Snapshot -> save a pic of error
  2. Run Task -> run any other task
  3. Log Data Into File -> create an log file for errors
  4. Send Email -> To send an email regarding the error
  5. Variable Assignment
  6. Set task status
  
* In error Handling ..if any task fails to accomplish, we can set it to do any of the above tasks
* There are 2 System Variables made to be used for error handling 
   * Error Description
   * Error Line Number
* <b>Variable Watch Table </b> -> it is used to check the variables changing if...```Dynamically```
* <b> Toggle Break Point </b> -> It is use to freeze the executing script and run a step of the process by self click only
* <b> Step Over </b> -> It is clicked to run the next step of process when the code is freezed
* Enabling ```Error Debugging``` mode gives you access to remove errors using its inbuilt features


## PDF Integration
* It allows you to copy text from pdf
* to merge or split two or more pdfs
* to encrypt or make pdf password protected and to decrypt as well

## Encryption
* It is of 2 types:
  1. Symmetric  -> same lock and unlock key
  2. Assymmetric -> differnt lock and unlock key
* In AA, we have 3 activities with us
  1. Encrypt Files -> easily set passphrase and encrypt with any given algorithm
  2. Decrypt Files
  3. Create keys
* Various Symmetric Algorithms available are:
  1. Idea
  2. TripleDES
  3. CAST5
  4. Blowfish
  5. AES128
  6. AES192
  7. AES256

## Process Maturity Model
* PMM is an evolutionary improveent path. This path guides organizations as they move towards automated business processes
* Each stage of the PMM is a foundation for the next stage to build upon, and the improvement strategy frawn from a PMM provides a roadmap for continuous process improvement.
* It has 5 stages:
    1. Automation Pipeline ~> This stage helps in identifying and prioritizing processes eligible for automation and includes two phases.These are:
        * Top Level Benefit Analysis
        * Candidate prioritization
    2. Feasibility Analysis ~> This is analysis ad evaluation of a process in the automation pipeline to understand if it is technically feasible within a specific cost bracket
    3. Complexity Assessment ~> This assessment helps determine the effort required to develop and standardize an automated process
    4. ROI Analysis ~> Return-on-Investment analysis helps determine the returns that will be gained upon investing in Automation
    5. Automation Design ~> This is the stage during which process-specific and infrastructure-specific automation solutions are designed
* Each of these stages is an elimination round for processes.Those that do not satisfy the requirement of any of these stages get eliminated from the automation pipeline

# Control Room Settings
* A role-based accessibility model ensures each User views information or data relevant to the role assigned to the User by the Control Room Administrator
* Web CR acts as a centralized server that enables monitoring,deploying and scheduling of Bots anywhere, anytime
* Repository Path ~> It is the shared path of the Control Room repository where physical files are stored
* Client Service Port ~> It is the default port used to communicate with the Enterprise Client
* WebSocket Service Path ~> It indicates the location of the machine from where the WebSocket service is hosted
    click ```tool icon``` to open in edit mode and input the IP or the Hostname and the Port
* The CR Acess URL indicates the path to either the local IIS, the reverse proxy or the load balancer - whichever is used for your web environment
    click ```tool icon``` to open in edit mode and input the IP or the Hostname and the Port
* Outgoing Mail Server Configuration ~> used to send email notifications which can be updated using this command
* Credential Vault ~> To Configure the settings for the Credential VAult, A super admin has tp choose between Express or Manual Mode where
    Express Mode: Use this to auto-connect to the Creential Vault(master key will be stored)
    Manual Mode: Use this to manually connect to the Credential Vault(Highly Secure as need passkey everytime)

## Client Configuration
* It enables you to control the mode of recording done by a Client for business processes.Control Room Administrator can go to CR Setting > Select Client Configuration, where the option Secure Recording is available
* What is:
    1. Secure Recording ~> It ensures none of the objects and properties that comprise sensitive information are captured (Default: Disabled)
    2. Automation Anywhere URLs ~> If you click AA's URLs,you are navigated to the default AA Support Site else 
    3. Product help URLs enable you to redirect user to the links for your own Customer Support Portal
    
## Client Usage Status 
* This tab shows the details regarding License Type , Purchased and Used Licensed
<b> License Type </b> ~> Basically there are 2 types of Licenses
    1. Development Clients are the ones who are given the privilege of creating tasks in Enterprise Client
    2. Runtime Clients are Users who are allowed to run tasks and if purchased, IQ-Bots and MetaBots
<b> Purchased </b> ~> The Purchased Licensed Type displays the number of licenses that have been purchased for Development Clients and TaskBot Clients
    1. Development Client Users can be allowed to create tasks that could include IQ-Bots and/or MetaBot if the required plugins have been installed
    2. The Runtime Client Users can be allowed licenses to enabe the Scheduling Manager - User with scheduling privileges , to run tasks on TaskBot Client User machines

## Allocate License to Client
1. Select the ```tool``` icon to launch the Client ```License Allocation" window and Select the Client type
    1. Select Development type for Bot Creator
    2. Select Runtime for BotRunners
    3. Select None,when you want to allocate license to the non-client users that is Users who are neither Bot Creators not Bot Runners
